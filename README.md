# SismoLog

## This is an iOS test app written in Swift

- **SismoLog** shows you the historical data of earthquakes, you can filter the data and see information about each earthquake on a world map.
- It's meant to be a simple example of fetching data from a server and showing it on a map inteface powered by GoogleMaps.
- Unfortunately the third party API http://www.seismi.org/api/eqs is no longer working so you won't see the earthquake data anymore.
